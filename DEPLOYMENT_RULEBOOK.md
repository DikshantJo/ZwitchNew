3. **ENABLE SSL/HTTPS** before going live
4. **REGULAR backups** are mandatory (daily recommended)
5. **KEEP dependencies updated** for security patches

### 🚀 Deployment Rules
1. **TEST locally first** - Never deploy untested code
2. **BACKUP before deployment** - Always have a rollback plan
3. **DEPLOY during low traffic** - Minimize user impact
4. **MONITOR after deployment** - Check for errors immediately
5. **DOCUMENT all changes** - Keep track of what was deployed

### 🔧 Technical Rules
1. **BUILD assets before deployment** - Ensure all CSS/JS is compiled
2. **CLEAR caches after deployment** - Prevent stale content
3. **CHECK permissions** - Ensure proper file/folder access
4. **VERIFY database connections** - Test before and after deployment
5. **OPTIMIZE for production** - Enable caching and compression

### 📊 Quality Assurance Rules
